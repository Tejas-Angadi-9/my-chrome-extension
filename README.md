## Overview

PR Assistant reads the GitHub compare page you have open, extracts context such as commit messages, branch names, and changed file names, then sends that context to Gemini to draft a PR title, description, or both. The result is rendered inline in the popup, and you can paste it directly into the GitHub PR form with one click.

## Features

- **AI-powered generation** — generate a PR title, description, or both using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Optional instructions** — steer the output with a free-text prompt (e.g. "keep it concise, use bullet points")
- **Markdown rendering** — generated content is rendered with proper formatting inside the popup
- **One-click paste** — apply the generated content directly into the GitHub PR title and description fields
- **Secure key storage** — Gemini API key is stored locally via `chrome.storage.local`, never sent anywhere else
- **Error handling** — clear feedback for invalid API keys, rate limits, and general failures
- **Keyboard shortcut** — press Enter in the instructions field to trigger generation

## Security & Privacy

**PR Assistant is designed with your privacy and code security in mind.**

- The extension only extracts commit messages, branch names, and changed file names from the GitHub compare page.
- **It does NOT access, read, or transmit the actual code changes or file contents.**
- All data extraction happens locally in your browser; only the minimal context (commit messages, branch names, file names) is sent to the Gemini API for PR generation.
- Your Gemini API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never shared externally.

This ensures your source code and sensitive information remain private and are never exposed to any third party.

---

## Usage Notes

- The extension only activates on GitHub compare pages (`github.com/*/compare/*`).
- On first use, you will be prompted to enter your Gemini API key. This is stored locally in the browser.
- The API key can be updated at any time by clearing it from Chrome extension storage and relaunching the popup.
- Content is extracted from the live GitHub DOM. The extension does not make any direct GitHub API calls.
